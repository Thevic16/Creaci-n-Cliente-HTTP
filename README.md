# Creaci-n-Cliente-HTTP


In this practice a program is made that receives a valid URL (Uniform Resource  Locator), with which to send an HTTP request (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)  to the  server.  The objective of  this program will be to interpret the HTML document (HyperText MarkupLanguage)   returned by the server. For the fulfillment of this purpose,  the HTTP Client 4.4 module of the Apache  components  library  and the JSOUPlibrary were used.  From  the tools provided by the libraries,  a  search, manipulation and analysis of the HTLM codewas completed, in this way obtaining information  that could be of high relevance for certain applications.
